# PENNYWISE - Personal Finance Tracker

## Overview

PENNYWISE is a personal finance tracker designed to help users effectively manage their income and expenses while providing insightful analytics about their financial health. With its intuitive interface and robust features, PENNYWISE allows users to track their income sources, manage expenses, and visualize savings in real-time.

## Features

### 1. Dashboard

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of a user's financial health with the following sections:

- **Total Income**: Displays the sum of balances from M-Pesa, Family Bank, and Equity Bank, which are initialized on the Settings page.
- **Total Expenses**: Aggregates all recorded expenses, categorized for clarity.
- **Total Savings**: Shows the difference between the initial currency balance (from the Settings page) and total expenses.

### 2. Settings Page

Users can set up initial balances for their accounts:

This setup is done under the "Initial Currency Setup" section and directly influences the Total Income displayed on the dashboard.
